## 📊 Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard recreates the **#WOW2023 Week 5** funnel-chart challenge, analyzing a simulated **sales pipeline** from *Prospecting* through *Closed Won*.  
It presents key metrics for pipeline performance and visualizes the progressive drop-off across stages.

---

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Total pipeline value: **$91.4 M**.  
- **39 % won**, **28 % lost**, and **33 % outstanding** opportunities.  
- As deals move down the funnel, stage-to-stage conversion decreases predictably.  
- Visualization highlights bottlenecks between *Value Proposition* → *Negotiation / Review*.  

---

## 🧠 Tableau Techniques Used
- Parameter controls for dynamic funnel resizing  
- Calculated fields for stage conversion and totals  
- Horizontal stacked bars to simulate funnel taper  
- Dashboard KPIs for totals, won %, lost %, outstanding %  
- Color hierarchy from light → dark blue for visual emphasis
